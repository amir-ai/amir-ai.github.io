I am interested in machine learning applications in computer vision and pattern recognition.

### Publications

**Motevakel, A.**, Medvedev, A. (2014) **Localization of Deep Brain Stimulation Electrodes via Metal Artifacts in CT Images.** *36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC 2014).* [[Researchgate]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266265848_Localization_of_deep_brain_stimulation_electrodes_via_metal_artifacts_in_CT_images)

### Some previous projects

- Cooperative control of a group of robots by incorporating computer vision. The goal is keeping the formation of a triangle in order to carry a planar virtual load cooperatively. The leader knows the path and slave robots follow it without having any prior information about the path. [[Video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zClSwctSec)
